These are my xkb customisations. 


The material here was derived from a number of great sources.

I learned about XKB at these locations:
   https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_configuration_in_Xorg
   https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/X_KeyBoard_extension  (best reference)
     setxkbmap -print -verbose 10

   http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/90089/remapping-both-caps-lock-and-shiftcaps-lock-in-xkb

I decided on my final customisation strategy after reading this
   http://madduck.net/docs/extending-xkb/


The summary of my strategy is as follows
  1. create an explicit keymap which includes my customised symbol definitions 
  2. compile and load my keymap with my local include directories so I don't need to modify the system area.
  3. create autostart desktop application that gets called when I login.
      

The directories contain the following
1.  applications
    This directory contains example application files to be put in .config/autostart

2. bin
   contains shell commands that the desktop applications use to compile and install the keyboard map. 

3. keymaps
   These contain the keymaps for customised keyboard settings.  These are created by editing original keymap
   found from "setxkbmap -print" to add customised symbol definitions

4. symbols
   These files contain the key remapping symbol definitions that are the critical part of the configuration.
